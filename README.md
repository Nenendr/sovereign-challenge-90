# My 90 Day Mission
# The Sovereign 90-Day Architecture Challenge

> I, mahesh_jambagi, commit to the 90-day strict protocol.  
> My goal is to transition from CURRENT_ROLE to Sovereign Builder by building PROJECT_NAME by TARGET_DATE.

## Mission

- Ingest: DATA_SOURCE (for example, crypto prices API, e‑commerce orders, etc.)
- Transform: TOOLS (for example, dbt + Snowflake / Databricks / PostgreSQL)
- Visualize: BUSINESS_METRIC (for example, revenue, churn, portfolio PnL)

## Progress

- [x] Phase 1 – Foundation (Weeks 1–4)
- [ ] Phase 2 – Structure (Weeks 5–8)
- [ ] Phase 3 – Execution (Weeks 9–12)

## Rules

- No Zero Days → at least one commit every day.
- No “Upload files” button on GitHub → CLI only.
- Functional Python only → pure functions, type hints, docstrings.
